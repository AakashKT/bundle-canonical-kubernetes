# Elastic Monitoring

## Scaling Elasticsearch

ElasticSearch is used to hold all the log data and server information logged by
Beats. You can add more Elasticsearch nodes by using the Juju command:

```
juju add-unit elasticsearch
```

## Accessing the Kibana dashboard

The Kibana dashboard can display real time graphs and charts on the details of
the cluster. The Beats charms are sending metrics to Elasticsearch and
Kibana displays the data with graphs and charts.

Get the charm's public address from the `juju status` command.

* Access Kibana by browser:  http://KIBANA_IP_ADDRESS/
* Select the index pattern that you want as default from the left menu.
  * Click the green star button to make this index a default.
* Select "Dashboard" from the Kibana header.
  * Click the open folder icon to Load a Saved Dashboard.
* Select the "Topbeat Dashboard" from the left menu.
